## Description

This repo contains a report, helper.py, movies.py, and train.tsv. The report is the written portion of the project. Helper.py is simply a 
script that shows in more detail the custom sentiment processing function. Finally, the full implementation is in movies.py using the data train.tsv. 
This file contains traditional ML and deep learning in Tensorflow.
